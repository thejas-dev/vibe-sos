# **App Name**: SlideSafe Web

## Core Features:

- SOS Slider: A slide-to-activate SOS interface component.
- Record Evidence: Automatically begin video and audio recording via the webcam and microphone.
- Get Geolocation: Fetch the user's geolocation from the browser.
- AI Audio Threat Detection: Use an AI tool to classify the audio stream to detect keywords or sound patterns related to threatening or emergency situations.
- Send Notifications: Automatically send a notification to law enforcement, first responders, and emergency contacts.
- Encrypt Evidence: Use end-to-end encryption of any recordings stored on the user's computer or sent through the internet.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) to evoke a sense of security and trust.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#E5E7EB), a soft neutral shade to ensure legibility and a calm feel.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#E67700) to highlight the slider and critical alert buttons.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines. 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) will be used for displaying code snippets if the app needs to.
- Use clear, high-contrast icons to represent actions and status indicators. The visual language should be universally understandable.
- The layout will be simple and direct, with high information hierarchy. A prominent SOS slider must be accessible above all else.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback to the user. Animations should clearly signal the activation and deactivation of SOS mode, but should not be obtrusive.
